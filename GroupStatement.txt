As a concept design a gaming community website that is designed to attract gamers to be part of a fun and friendly community. 
Providing details for certain games information that they can use to join and play together online. 

We agreed with each other on who would design each page and who would start the main page. 
I was going to start the main page and Kieran and John would add to this I also had the separate page for Rust Game details to create. 
Kieran wanted to create the Destiny 2 and Ark server pages and John wanted to create the Battlefield and Forza pages as well as both adding links to these pages on the main page. 

During the creation of the Main Page I decided to adjust the main page design compared to the workflow we had agreed on. For the Contacts us, Settings, Sign in I decided to do the following:- 

Removed Settings altogether users shouldnâ€™t need settings for the webpage. 

Created a navigation bar below the Web Page Header and within the Navigation bar I put in the Contact Us and Sign-in area. 
Also next to this I added a home button to take the user back to the home page info if they had went into Contact us.
