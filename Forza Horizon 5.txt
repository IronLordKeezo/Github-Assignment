		Forza Horizon 5 Information
	</header2>

<p>
 Forza Horizon 5 is a game that got relaased on 5 November 2021 . It is a racing video game developed by Playground Games and published by Xbox Game Studios. 
It is the fifth Forza Horizon title and twelfth main instalment in the Forza series. The game is set in a fictionalised representation of Mexico. 
Several vehicles are making their franchise debut in Forza Horizon 5. From the sheer scale and durability of the 2020 Ford Super Duty F-450 DRW Premium 
to the exceptionally rare, naturally aspirated 1991 Jaguar Sport XJR-15 and the all-electric 2020 Porsche Taycan Turbo S, the new additions to our roster 
are the most diverse they’ve ever been in Forza history.

Forza Horizon 5 also introduces some of the world’s most innovative cars to the franchise – and our cover cars are no exception. The Mercedes-AMG ONE 
brings Formula 1 hybrid technology almost one-to-one from the track to the street for the first time ever, while the 2021 Ford Bronco Badlands combines 
the toughness of an F-Series truck and the performance spirit of Mustang to deliver an exhilarating off-road experience.
	
An enormous visual upgrade, especially to lighting, tyre smoke, and dust effects. Hundreds and hundreds of new custom parts, rims, and performance mods, 
and cars with more character than ever. Drastic sound improvements, better handling, more granular preferences and options, more online activities. 
It really is incredible across the board.
